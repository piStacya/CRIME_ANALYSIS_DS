# CRIME_ANALYSIS_DS
## Overview
This project explores crime trends across European countries using publicly available data from Eurostat and provides a reproducible exploratory analysis of crime patterns across Europe.<br>
The objective was to apply core data science skills: data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, visualization, and interpretation, to produce meaningful insights about crime patterns from 2008–2023.<br>
The project uses crime categories defined by the ICCS (International Classification of Crime Statistics) framework, allowing consistent comparison across countries and years.

The analysis also identifies:
  <li>Crime trends over the years for each ICCS category</li>
  <li>Countries with the highest rates for each crime type</li>
  <li>Top crime categories for each country and year</li>

This project is purely descriptive and does not make causal claims.
## Project goals
Collect and clean multiple Eurostat crime datasets
Standardize crime categories using ICCS codes
Handle missing values and reporting inconsistencies
Perform exploratory data analysis to find:
<li>long-term crime trends</li>
<li>peaks, declines, anomalies</li>
<li>country-specific crime structures</li>
Present insights visually through clear, interpretable plots

## Tools and technologies used
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Pandas — data manipulation</li>
  <li>NumPy — numeric operations</li>
  <li>Matplotlib — plotting</li>
  <li>Seaborn — visualization support</li>
  <li>Jupyter Notebook — analysis environment</li>
