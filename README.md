# CRIME_ANALYSIS_DS
## Overview
This project explores crime trends across European countries using publicly available data from Eurostat and provides a reproducible exploratory analysis of crime patterns across Europe.

The objective was to apply core data science skills: data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, visualization, and interpretation, to produce meaningful insights about crime patterns from mainly 2008–2023, but also using historic data from 1993-2007.

The project uses crime categories defined by the ICCS (International Classification of Crime Statistics) framework, allowing consistent comparison across countries and years.

The analysis also identifies:
- Crime trends over the years for each ICCS category  
- Countries with the highest rates for each crime type  
- Top crime categories for each country and year  

This project is purely descriptive and does not make causal claims.

## Project goals
- Collect and clean multiple Eurostat crime datasets  
- Standardize crime categories using ICCS codes  
- Handle missing values and reporting inconsistencies  
- Perform exploratory data analysis to find:  
  - long-term crime trends  
  - peaks, declines, and anomalies  
  - country-specific crime patterns  
- Present insights visually through clear, interpretable plots  

## Tools and technologies used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** — data manipulation  
- **NumPy** — numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** — plotting  
- **Seaborn** — visualization support  
- **Jupyter Notebook** — analysis environment
