# Scripts

It should be enough to run just the cleaning.py file.    
If you want to use more of these scripts to clean your data and aim to get the same results then run **ONLY** the following python files in this order:

1. first_column_separation.py (this script requires you to specify the path to your data and it only changes one table at a time)
2. nan_rows.py
3. cleaning.py

The cleaning.py script will take care of the rest.

We recommend running the cleaning.py script first.

We also advise you not to run the ICCS_to_crime.py script if you wish to replicate the analysis written in the Jupyter notebooks.
